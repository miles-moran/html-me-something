                <p>In 2016, I left St. Louis, Missouri to cross the border and try out a life on the coast. I had no grasp on Spanish, but I had a tax return. I
                    paid for six months of rent for an apartment in the tourist city of Puerto Vallarta. While the idea was romantic, life got to be lonely before
                    I met the Rios family. After befriending identical twins Aaron and Moises Rios, I began sleeping over with the Mexican family. One night a week 
                    became two... Two became three... And eventually, when my lease expired, I packed my things and moved in. Life was different. I had
                    more than a dozen roomates: </p>
                    <p>Abertha, Ramon, Patricia, Miriam, Moises, Aaron, Josue, Eric, Brandon, Angel, Britany, Diana, and two dogs, Kala and Estrella.</p>
                    <h2><u>My Favorite Places in Vallarta</u></h2>
                    <p>I found family in Vallarta, but I fell in love with the city itself. With the help of my friends, I discovered:

                <h3>Loma Bonita</h3>
                <p>Loma Bonita is outside the tourist zone and sits in front of the mountains that run through the state of Jalisco. It is where the Rios family and I
                    lived.

                <h3>Pitillal</h3> 
                <p>Pitillal is a populated "downtown" area near Loma Bonita. It is the most heavily populated spot in Vallarta besides the touristy "El Centro". While
                    both mantain a sense of culture, Pitillal feels like real Mexico.</p>

                <h3>La Aurora</h3>
                <p>La Aurora is a neighborhood that can be found behind the mall. Though it sits outside the biggest road in Vallarta, its hidden away by beautiful apartment buildings.
                    La Aurora has tons of taco stands that serve tacos al pastor, tacos de asada, and any other type you can think of. </p>

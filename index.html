                <p>In 2016, I left St. Louis, Missouri to cross the border and try out a life on the coast. I had no grasp on Spanish, but I had a tax return. I
                    paid for six months of rent for an apartment in the tourist city of Puerto Vallarta. While the idea was romantic, life got to be lonely before
                    I met the Rios family. After befriending identical twins Aaron and Moises Rios, I began sleeping over with the Mexican family. One night a week 
                    became two... Two became three... And eventually, when my lease expired, I packed my things and moved in. Life was different. I had
                    more than a dozen roomates: </p>
                <p>Abertha, Ramon, Patricia, Miriam, Moises, Aaron, Josue, Eric, Brandon, Angel, Britany, Diana, and two dogs, Kala and Estrella.</p>

                <h2>My Favorite Places in Vallarta</h2>
                <p>I found family in Vallarta, but I fell in love with the city itself. With the help of my friends, I discovered:

                <h3>Loma Bonita</h3>
                <p>Loma Bonita is outside the tourist zone and sits in front of the mountains that run through the state of Jalisco. It is where the Rios family and I</p>

                <h3>The Stadium</h3>
                <p>There is an enormous park in Loma Bonita where everything from weight equipment, to swimming pools, and basketball courts can be found. Though, I didn't
                    "ball" before I arrived in Vallarta, I took advantage of my height and started playing with locals everyday. </p>

                <h3>Pitillal</h3> 
                <p>Pitillal is a populated "downtown" area near Loma Bonita. It is the most heavily populated spot in Vallarta besides the touristy "El Centro". While
                    both mantain a sense of culture, Pitillal feels like real Mexico.</p>

                <h3>Las Gallerias</h3>
                <p>Las Gallerias is the "nicest" mall that can be found in Vallarta. I hung out there because of the air conditioning I could not find at home and Starbuck's.</p>

                <h3>La Aurora</h3>
                <p>La Aurora is a neighborhood that can be found behind the mall. Though it sits outside the biggest road in Vallarta, its hidden away by beautiful apartment buildings.
                    La Aurora has tons of taco stands that serve tacos al pastor, tacos de asada, and any other type you can think of. </p>

                <p>Though the buses of Vallarta feel dated, there's something charming about them.</p>
